#  This app is still in development ðŸš§

# [Todo App](https://dontdo.tech/)

This Todo App allows users create, read, update and delete (CRUD) events they wish to track.

The technologies used in the app are the same that were used in the hackernews-react-apollo in order to allow
me to practise more using GraphQL with the aid of Apollo Client.

## Technologies

* Frontend:
    * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
    * [Apollo Client - GraphicQL Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react)
* Backend
    * [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server)
    * [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/apollo)
    * [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

## How to run

### `npm start`
